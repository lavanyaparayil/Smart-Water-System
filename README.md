# Smart Water Management System üíß

An automated water level monitoring and pump control system using **Arduino Uno**, **ultrasonic sensor**, and **RTC module**, designed to reduce water wastage, prevent pump damage, and promote energy-efficient tank management in residential settings.

---

## üîß Key Features
- üö∞ Automated pump control via level thresholds  
- ‚è∞ RTC-based daily water usage lock system  
- üìü Real-time LCD display with water level & status  
- üî¥üü° LED indicators for tank status alerts  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Reliable offline operation, energy-efficient and low maintenance

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- RTC Module (DS3231)  
- 1-Channel Relay Module  
- Mini DC Water Pump  
- 16x2 LCD Display with I¬≤C  
- LEDs (Red & Yellow), Resistors  
- Breadboard, Jumper Wires  
- 5V USB Power Supply

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow

- Ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors tank level  
- When water is **below the lower threshold**, the pump turns ON and the Red LED lights up  
- When the tank reaches the **upper threshold**, the pump turns OFF and locks for the day; Yellow LED lights up  
- RTC resets the system at midnight  
- LCD displays current water level and pump status in real time

---

## üí° Applications
- Automated tank management in homes & apartments  
- School/hostel water monitoring  
- Rural & urban water conservation setups  
- Indoor gardens or irrigation systems

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Add water flow sensors for precision usage tracking  
- Mobile app or web dashboard integration  
- ThingSpeak/IoT-based monitoring & control
